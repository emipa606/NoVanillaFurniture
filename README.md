# NoVanillaFurniture

Just a simple patch-mod that removes all vanilla furniture definitions from the game. 

For players that want to only use and find modded furniture.

Base-classes are untouched so they still can be used by mods.

Things that are referenced in linkable facilities or requirements for royals have been replaced with empty defs.

Left the joy and royal-items, can remove them if needed.

Since modding is just a hobby for me I expect no donations to keep modding. If you still want to show your support you can gift me anything from my https://store.steampowered.com/wishlist/id/Mlie]Wishlist or buy me a cup of tea.
